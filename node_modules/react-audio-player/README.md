# React Audio Player
This is a light React wrapper around the HTML5 audio tag.  It provides the ability to manipulate the player and listen to events through a nice React interface.

## Installation

    npm install --save react-audio-player

## Usage

    <ReactAudioPlayer
      src="my_audio_file.ogg"
      autoPlay
    />

### Example

See the example directory for a basic working example of using this.  You can run it with the command `npm run example`.

## Advanced Usage

### Access to the audio element
You can get direct access to the underlying audio element.  First get a ref to ReactAudioPlayer:

    <ReactAudioPlayer
      ref={c => { this.rap = c }
    />

Then you can access the audio element like this:

    this.rap.audioEl
